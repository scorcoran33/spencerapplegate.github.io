I am happy to finally get my blog up and running!  I am currently using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  I am using a SVBTLE theme created by [Orlando](https://github.com/orlando/svbtle-jekyll).  Kudos are served from a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) [Node](http://nodejs.org/) server coupled to a [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com) instance for persistance.  Welcome to Clear and Present Thoughts!
