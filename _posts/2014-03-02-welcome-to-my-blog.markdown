![Clear and Present Thoughts]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/clear_and_present_danger.jpg)

I am happy to finally get my blog up and running!  I am currently using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  I am using a SVBTLE theme and a kudos server model created by [Orlando](https://github.com/orlando).  Kudos are served from a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) [Node](http://nodejs.org/) server coupled to a [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com) instance for persistance.  Site code is hosted [here](https://github.com/spencerapplegate/spencerapplegate.github.io) and kudos server code is hosted [here](https://github.com/spencerapplegate/kudos-server).  Welcome to Clear and Present Thoughts!
